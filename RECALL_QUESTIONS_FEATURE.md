# ðŸ§  Recall Questions Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a **Recall Questions** feature for cognitive flashcards to enable quiz-based learning and self-testing.

## What Was Added

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Engineering
**File:** `prompts/intelligent_flashcard_prompt.txt`

- Added instructions for generating 2-3 diverse recall questions per flashcard
- Specified three question types:
  - **MCQ (Multiple Choice)**: 4 options (1 correct, 3 plausible distractors)
  - **Fill-in-the-Blank**: Key concept replaced with "________"
  - **True/False**: Definitive statements

### 2. Updated Flashcard Schema
**JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "recall_questions": [
    {
      "type": "mcq | fill_in_the_blank | true_false",
      "question": "The question text",
      "options": ["a", "b", "c", "d"],  // Only for MCQ
      "answer": "The correct answer"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Python Generator
**File:** `cognitive_flashcard_generator.py`

**Changes:**
- Added recall questions parsing and validation
- Updated stats display to show total recall questions
- Enhanced text export with:
  - "ðŸ§  RECALL PRACTICE" section per card
  - MCQs with labeled options (a, b, c, d)
  - Answer Key section at the bottom

## Test Results

### From MIS_lec_1-3 Processing:
- **Total Flashcards:** 16
- **Recall Questions:** 33 total (~2 per card)
- **Question Distribution:**
  - MCQs: ~50% (with 4 options each)
  - Fill-in-the-Blank: ~30%
  - True/False: ~20%

## Output Formats

### 1. JSON Export
Perfect for React frontend integration:

### 2. Text Study Guide
Exam-ready study tool:
- Questions displayed with clear formatting
- MCQ options labeled (a, b, c, d)
- Answers hidden at the bottom
- Prevents accidental peeking

## Key Features

âœ… **4-Option MCQs** - Industry standard for effective testing
