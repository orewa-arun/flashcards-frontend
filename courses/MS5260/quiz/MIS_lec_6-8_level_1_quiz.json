        "text": "Combining supervised and unsupervised learning provides a more comprehensive and robust fraud detection system. Supervised models are effective at identifying known fraud patterns based on labeled historical data, while unsupervised anomaly detection is crucial for catching new, evolving, or previously unseen fraud schemes that do not have existing labels.",
        "step_by_step": [],
        "interpretation": "The visual emphasizes that a 'Hybrid' approach (combining Supervised and Unsupervised) leads to 'Catch All Frauds', whereas relying on 'Supervised Only' risks 'Missed New Frauds'.",
        "business_context": "This dual approach is essential for staying ahead of sophisticated fraudsters and minimizing financial losses from both established and emerging threats."
