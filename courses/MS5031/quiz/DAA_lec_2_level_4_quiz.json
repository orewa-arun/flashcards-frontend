They run a simple linear regression model where `Y` is daily sales revenue (in USD) and `X` is daily advertising spend on social media (in USD). After collecting 60 days of data, their initial model shows a strong positive linear relationship with a high R-squared value and a statistically significant advertising coefficient. However, the data scientist observes that on days with extremely high advertising spend, the residuals show a noticeable upward trend, and the sales figures for these high-spend days seem to plateau rather than continue increasing linearly. Furthermore, the marketing director is pushing to double the advertising budget next quarter, assuming the strong correlation means increased ad spend *directly causes* a proportional increase in sales. Which of the following issues should the data scientist raise to the marketing director, synthesizing the purpose of simple regression with OLS assumptions and common pitfalls?

        "C": "Doubling the advertising budget next quarter based on the current model involves significant extrapolation beyond the observed range of advertising spend, which can lead to unreliable predictions as the underlying relationship might change.",
        "D": "The high R-squared value, by itself, does not guarantee that the OLS assumptions, particularly homoscedasticity, are met, and the residual pattern suggests potential issues with the model's predictive power for higher ad spends.",

Option A is correct because the upward trend in residuals at high X values and the plateauing sales suggest a non-linear relationship (e.g., diminishing returns), violating the linearity assumption for the simple linear model. This means the model's predictions at high ad spend will be systematically biased. Option B is correct as it directly addresses the 'correlation vs. causation' pitfall, a critical misconception in simple regression (FC1, common mistakes). Option C is correct because doubling the budget represents a significant extrapolation beyond the observed data range (FC5, FC8), making predictions unreliable, as the linear relationship may not hold. Option D points to a relevant issue (homoscedasticity) but the primary concern with the upward trend in residuals at high spend for the CEO's conclusion is linearity and extrapolation. Option E is true but doesn't address the core issues of assumption violation or misinterpretation of causation, and is a distractor that acknowledges a correct statistical finding without addressing its limitations.",

They use a simple regression model to predict the number of successful deliveries per day (`Y`) based on the number of active drones (`X`). After analyzing data from 90 operational days, the model appears to have a reasonable R-squared. However, a junior analyst notices that the residuals from days with very few active drones are consistently positive and small, while residuals from days with many active drones are much larger and also positive, forming a \"fan\" shape.

The description states that residuals are 'consistently positive and small' for low drone counts and 'much larger and also positive' for high drone counts. This means the actual Y values are consistently *above* the predicted ŷ values across the range, implying the linear model is systematically underpredicting. This pattern, particularly the consistent positivity, strongly suggests that the underlying relationship is not linear and a linear model is misspecified, violating the linearity assumption. While a fan shape *also* indicates heteroscedasticity (Option A), the consistently positive nature across the range points more directly to a non-linear relationship and systematic underprediction. If the residuals were randomly scattered but widened, it would be purely heteroscedasticity. Here, the systematic *positive* deviation from the line, even while widening, indicates the linear model is fundamentally missing the curve. Option C is incorrect; a fan shape doesn't directly indicate independence violation. Option D is incorrect; a fan shape with consistently positive residuals clearly shows a problem with the model, not perfect linearity.",

Option A is correct because applying the fertilizer at 500 kg/hectare is a significant extrapolation (FC5, FC8) from the observed range of 50-200 kg/hectare. The linear relationship may not hold, and there could be diminishing returns or even negative effects (toxicity) at such high dosages. Option B is correct as the 'common mistake' in simple regression (FC1) and pitfalls (FC5, FC8) explicitly warns against confusing correlation with causation. The model shows association, but doesn't prove the fertilizer *causes* the yield increase, nor does it account for other necessary conditions. Option C is correct because the estimated line provides a point prediction, but individual outcomes (like a specific plot's yield) have inherent variability (residuals, FC4) around that prediction. Prediction intervals (FC6) account for this, and a 'guaranteed' outcome ignores this uncertainty. Option D is correct as it highlights the fundamental distinction between sample estimates (b₀, b₁) from the Estimated Regression Line (FC3) and the true, unknown Population Regression Function parameters (β₀, β₁) (FC2, FC3 common mistakes).

The lead data scientist notes that while the model seems to fit well within the observed interaction times (10-60 minutes/day), the underlying psychological principles suggest that beyond a certain point (e.g., 90 minutes), engagement might either plateau or even decrease due to cognitive overload, an effect not captured by the current linear model.

      "explanation": "This question integrates the Simple Regression Model (FC1), Population Regression Function (PRF) (FC2), and OLS Assumptions (FC5). The core issue described is that while the model fits within the observed range, theoretical understanding suggests a non-linear relationship (plateauing or decreasing engagement) outside this range. This directly points to a violation of the linearity assumption (FC5). The simple linear model assumes a straight-line relationship across all X values, but the true PRF (FC2) for engagement is likely curvilinear. Therefore, using the linear model for prediction or policy outside the observed range will be misleading. Option B is incorrect; an R-squared value for the observed range doesn't directly indicate a linearity violation outside that range, though it might be less useful. Option C is incorrect; cognitive overload is a property of the X-Y relationship or an unmodeled factor (part of ε), not a direct violation of independence between *errors* of different students. Option D is incorrect; individual differences are typically absorbed into the error term (ε) of the PRF (FC2) and don't inherently cause bias in OLS coefficients *unless* they are correlated with X, which is not stated here.",

Option A is the correct interpretation of a confidence interval (FC9, FC10). It states that we are 95% confident that the *true population parameter* (β₁ in the PRF, FC2) lies within the given range. This range quantifies the uncertainty of the estimated slope (b₁, FC3). Option B is incorrect; the confidence interval is for the fixed, unknown population parameter, not for future sample estimates (FC9 common mistakes). Option C is incorrect; this describes a prediction interval for an individual observation (FC6), not a confidence interval for a population parameter (FC9, FC10). Option D is partially correct in that zero not being in the interval suggests statistical significance, but the term 'definitively' is too strong given it's an estimate, and it doesn't fully capture the meaning of the interval as a range of plausible values for β₁.",

They want to provide a 99% prediction interval for the sea level rise in the year 2050, given a projected temperature anomaly.

      "explanation": "This question synthesizes the Population Regression Function (PRF) (FC2), OLS Assumptions (FC5), and Prediction Interval Assumptions (FC7). Option A is correct. The statement 'rate of sea level rise might accelerate non-linearly' directly implies that the true relationship (PRF, FC2) is not linear, violating the linearity assumption (FC5). This makes a simple linear model inadequate for future predictions, especially for 2050. Option B is correct. 'Variability of sea level measurements has increased over time' indicates that the error variance is not constant, which is a violation of the homoscedasticity assumption (FC5). This will lead to an unreliable prediction interval (FC6, FC7), where the reported uncertainty might be too small for high-variability periods or too large for low-variability periods. Option C is correct. Predicting for 2050 based on historical data likely means the projected temperature anomaly (X for 2050) falls outside the range of observed X values in the historical dataset. This is a clear violation of the 'no extrapolation' assumption for prediction intervals (FC7, FC8), making the prediction highly unreliable. Option D is correct. Heteroscedasticity (violation of homoscedasticity, FC5) leads to biased standard errors for the coefficients and thus biased standard errors for prediction. This directly impacts the width and reliability of the prediction interval (FC6, FC7), causing it to misrepresent the true uncertainty.",

The described residual pattern (overestimation at low X, underestimation at high X, or vice-versa) is a classic indicator of non-linearity, violating the linearity assumption (FC5). This means the true relationship between steps and calorie burn is likely curvilinear, and a simple linear model is misspecified. Option B is correct. If the linearity assumption is violated, OLS estimates (b₀, b₁) are no longer guaranteed to be BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimators) (FC5). This means the coefficients are likely biased, and their interpretation as the true effect of X on Y is flawed. Option C is correct. Since the model systematically mispredicts at the extremes of step counts, implementing it directly will provide inaccurate personalized calorie tracking for a significant portion of users, leading to poor user experience and potentially misleading health advice. Option D is incorrect. While independence of errors (FC5) is crucial, a pattern in residuals (like a U-shape) primarily points to a linearity violation, not necessarily a correlation between errors of different individuals in this context, unless there's specific information about data collection order or group effects.",

A confidence interval (FC9, FC10) would provide a range of plausible values for the true `β₁`.
