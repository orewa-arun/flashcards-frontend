      "visual_type": "None",
      "visual_code": "",

      "explanation": "The scenario describes predicting customer spending using two variables: online ad clicks and email opens. MLR's advantage lies in its ability to incorporate multiple independent variables to explain the variation in the dependent variable. SLR is limited to only one independent variable, making MLR more suitable here. Option B is incorrect because MLR aims for a more comprehensive model, not necessarily higher accuracy with a single variable. Option C is incorrect as the linearity assumption applies to both. Option D is irrelevant to the core concept.",
