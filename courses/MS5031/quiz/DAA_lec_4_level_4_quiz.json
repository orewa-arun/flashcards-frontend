      "question_text": "A data scientist is building a model to predict customer churn at a telecommunications company. They use Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) with several independent variables, including monthly bill amount, number of customer service calls, and contract length. Upon reviewing the model, they find that the coefficient for 'monthly bill amount' is positive and statistically significant, suggesting that higher bills lead to increased churn. However, they also observe a high degree of correlation between 'monthly bill amount' and 'contract length' (longer contracts often have lower monthly bills). Considering the concept of 'partial regression coefficients' and the challenges of multicollinearity, what is the MOST likely explanation for the unexpected positive coefficient for 'monthly bill amount' in this scenario?",

      "alt_text": "",
      "options": {
        "A": "The positive coefficient is accurate and reflects a genuine causal relationship; customers with higher bills are simply more likely to churn, regardless of their contract length.",
        "B": "Multicollinearity is suppressing the true effect of 'monthly bill amount'. The partial regression coefficient reflects the effect of bill amount *after* controlling for contract length, meaning that *for customers with the same contract length*, those with higher bills are more likely to churn.",
        "C": "The model is suffering from omitted variable bias. A critical variable related to customer satisfaction (e.g., network reliability) has been left out, leading to a spurious correlation between bill amount and churn.",
        "D": "The data contains outliers with extremely high bill amounts and short contract lengths, unduly influencing the regression results. Removing these outliers will likely eliminate the positive coefficient."
      },
      "correct_answer": "Multicollinearity is suppressing the true effect of 'monthly bill amount'. The partial regression coefficient reflects the effect of bill amount *after* controlling for contract length, meaning that *for customers with the same contract length*, those with higher bills are more likely to churn.",
      "explanation": "This question combines the concepts of multicollinearity (addressed implicitly in the 'common mistakes' of the MLR definition flashcard) and partial regression coefficients (DAA_lec_4_2). The key is understanding that the partial regression coefficient represents the effect of a variable *holding all others constant*. Multicollinearity inflates the variance of the coefficients, making interpretation difficult. Option A ignores the multicollinearity. Option C introduces an unrelated issue (omitted variable bias). Option D is a possible but less likely explanation, as multicollinearity is more fundamental here. The correct answer (B) highlights that the positive coefficient, while counterintuitive, reflects the effect of bill amount *after* controlling for contract length. Customers with the *same* contract length are more likely to churn if they have higher bills. The multicollinearity makes the overall interpretation complex, requiring careful consideration of the partial effect.",

      "question_text": "A financial analyst is developing an MLR model to predict stock prices based on several factors, including the company's earnings per share (EPS), price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio. Before finalizing the model, the analyst examines a Scatterplot Matrix (Scatmat) of all the variables. The Scatmat reveals a strong linear relationship between EPS and stock price, as expected. However, it also shows a very strong positive relationship between P/E ratio and *analyst recommendations* (on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being a 'strong buy'). Furthermore, the analyst knows from prior experience (and external data) that analyst recommendations strongly influence stock price. Synthesizing the role of a Scatmat in EDA and the concept of partial regression coefficients, what is the MOST likely consequence of including both P/E ratio and analyst recommendations in the MLR model?",

        "C": "Including both variables will likely result in a spurious relationship between P/E ratio and stock price. The partial regression coefficient for P/E ratio will be biased because it doesn't account for the confounding effect of analyst recommendations.",

      "explanation": "This question combines the purpose of Scatmat (DAA_lec_4_4) with multicollinearity (addressed implicitly in the 'common mistakes' of DAA_lec_4_1). The Scatmat reveals a strong relationship between P/E and analyst recommendations. This indicates likely multicollinearity. Option A is incorrect because multicollinearity *does* impact the interpretability of individual coefficients. Option C describes a spurious relationship and confounding, but multicollinearity is the more direct consequence here. Option D introduces endogeneity, which is a more complex issue not directly indicated by the Scatmat alone. The correct answer (B) acknowledges the multicollinearity and its impact on coefficient interpretation and standard errors. The overall predictive power *might* be okay, but individual coefficient analysis becomes problematic. This is a trade-off: potentially better prediction vs. interpretable parameters.",

After fitting the model, the scientist observes significant heteroscedasticity in the residuals – the variance of the errors is much larger for high AQI values than for low AQI values.

Option A is incorrect; Box-Cox transforms address non-normality, not heteroscedasticity directly. Option B suggests removing a variable based on VIF (multicollinearity), which is unrelated to heteroscedasticity. Option C, Weighted Least Squares, is a valid approach but requires careful estimation of the weights and can be less intuitive to interpret. The logarithmic transformation of the dependent variable (D) is often the *most* practical solution. It stabilizes the variance and allows for interpretation of the coefficients as approximate percentage changes, balancing correction with interpretability. The key is recognizing that transforming the *dependent* variable is often more effective and interpretable than transforming the *independent* variables in this scenario.",

After building the model, the analysts notice that the residuals exhibit a clear pattern of non-independence: weeks with higher-than-predicted sales tend to be followed by weeks with higher-than-predicted sales, and vice-versa. This suggests a violation of the 'Independence of Errors' assumption of MLR.

      "explanation": "This question combines the assumptions of MLR (DAA_lec_4_3) with potential causes and solutions for violating the independence assumption. The key is the *temporal* pattern in the residuals. Option A is incorrect because multicollinearity doesn't directly cause non-independence of *errors*. Option C is incorrect because heteroscedasticity (unequal variance) is a different issue than non-independence. Option D addresses non-linearity, which doesn't explain the temporal pattern in the residuals. The correct answer (B) identifies omitted variable bias as the most likely root cause. The temporal pattern suggests that unmeasured factors (like seasonality or competitor actions) are influencing sales and are correlated over time. Including lagged values of the dependent variable (previous week's sales) captures some of this temporal dependence, addressing the non-independence of errors. This introduces autocorrelation but mitigates the violation of the independence assumption.",

Option A, removing a variable, is a common approach but sacrifices information and might not be the *best* solution if both variables are relevant. Option B, creating an interaction term, can address non-linearity or synergistic effects but does not directly solve multicollinearity and can complicate interpretation. Option C, PCA, creates uncorrelated variables but makes the model *less* interpretable because the principal components are abstract combinations of the original variables. The correct answer (D), creating a composite variable, directly addresses multicollinearity *and* maintains interpretability. A 'living space index' is easily understood by clients and captures the combined effect of square footage and bedrooms. This approach balances the need to address multicollinearity with the need for clear, understandable results for a non-technical audience. The trade-off is potential information loss in creating the index, but this is acceptable given the strong multicollinearity and the emphasis on interpretability.",

Additionally, it may overestimate satisfaction for those with a very *high* number of resolved tickets because it doesn't capture the plateau/decline in satisfaction at high resolution volumes.",
