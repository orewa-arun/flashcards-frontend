      "question_text": "A national restaurant chain, 'TasteBuds', launched a new advertising campaign across 50 of its locations. A data analyst, eager to demonstrate impact, performed a simple regression of monthly sales revenue (Y) on monthly advertising spend (X) and found a strong positive correlation (R-squared = 0.85). Based on this, the marketing director decided to double the advertising budget for all underperforming locations, expecting a proportionate increase in sales. Three months later, sales had not increased as expected, and some locations even saw a slight dip. What is the most likely fundamental error in the marketing director's decision?",

      "explanation": "The key issue here is the common mistake of confusing correlation with causation. While the simple regression model quantifies the association (correlation) between advertising spend and sales, it does not prove that increased advertising *causes* increased sales. Confounding factors, such as local economic conditions, seasonality, or competitor actions, could be driving both advertising spend (perhaps responsive to anticipated sales) and actual sales. Doubling the budget based solely on correlation assumes a direct causal link that may not exist, leading to misallocation of resources. Option A is a possibility but not the *most likely fundamental error* given the common pitfall. Option B suggests extrapolation, which is a related pitfall but the primary logical leap is causation. Option D relates to an OLS assumption, but the core failure is conceptual. The trick is the immediate jump from 'strong correlation' to 'causal intervention'.",
