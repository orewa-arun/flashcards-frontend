Create comprehensive flashcards following these principles:

1. **EXAM-FOCUSED**: Focus on testable concepts, formulas, definitions, and problem-solving steps
2. **MEMORABLE**: Use mnemonics, analogies, and memory triggers where possible
3. **QUICK TO REVIEW**: Questions should be concise; answers should be complete but focused
4. **PROGRESSIVE DIFFICULTY**: Mix easy recall questions with challenging application questions
5. **PRACTICAL**: Include formula applications, when to use what method, common mistakes

CRITICAL - LATEX FORMATTING:
- For ALL mathematical formulas, equations, and symbols, use proper LaTeX notation
- Inline math: wrap in $...$ (e.g., $\mu$, $\sigma^2$, $x = \frac{a}{b}$)
- Display math: wrap in $...$ for standalone equations (e.g., $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$)
- Greek letters: $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\mu$, $\sigma$, $\chi^2$, etc.
- Fractions: $\frac{numerator}{denominator}$
- Subscripts/Superscripts: $x_i$, $x^2$, $\sigma^2$
- Square root: $\sqrt{x}$, $\sqrt[n]{x}$
- Summation: $\sum_{i=1}^{n}$
- Integrals: $\int_{a}^{b}$
- Special functions: $\Gamma(k)$, $\chi^2(k)$

**IMPORTANT**: Use proper LaTeX notation with single backslashes. The system will handle JSON escaping automatically.

FLASHCARD TYPES TO CREATE:
- Definition cards: "What is X?" → Clear, concise definition with LaTeX for any math
- Formula cards: "What is the formula for X?" → Formula in beautiful LaTeX
- Application cards: "When do you use X?" → Conditions and use cases
- Concept cards: "Explain the relationship between X and Y" → Key connections
- Problem-solving cards: "How do you calculate X?" → Step-by-step with LaTeX
- Comparison cards: "What's the difference between X and Y?" → Clear distinctions
- Memory aid cards: "What's an easy way to remember X?" → Mnemonics or tricks

EXAMPLE OUTPUT WITH LATEX:
{
  "question": "What is the formula for a confidence interval when population standard deviation is known?",
  "answer": "The confidence interval is given by: $\bar{X} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ where $\bar{X}$ is the sample mean, $Z_{\alpha/2}$ is the critical value, $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size.",
  "type": "formula",
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "tags": ["confidence_interval", "statistics"]
}

Return ONLY a valid JSON array (no markdown, no backticks) with this exact format:
[
  {
    "question": "Question text with $LaTeX$ here?",
    "answer": "Answer text with $LaTeX$ equations here",
    "type": "definition|formula|application|concept|problem|comparison|memory",
    "difficulty": "easy|medium|hard",
    "tags": ["topic1", "topic2"]
  }
]

Generate 8-15 high-quality flashcards covering all important concepts with proper LaTeX formatting.
