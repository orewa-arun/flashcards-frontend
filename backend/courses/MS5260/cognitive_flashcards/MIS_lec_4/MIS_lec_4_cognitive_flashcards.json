        "analogy": "Think of an E-R model like a blueprint for a building. The entities are the rooms (e.g., bedroom, kitchen), the attributes are the characteristics of each room (e.g., size, color), and the relationships are how the rooms connect to each other (e.g., 'is adjacent to').",
        "eli5": "Imagine you're drawing a map of your toys. The E-R model is like that map. The toys are the 'entities,' their colors and sizes are their 'attributes,' and how they're grouped together is their 'relationship.'",

'Doctor' is another entity. The relationship 'Treats' connects patients to doctors, defining who is responsible for which patient.",
        "common_mistakes": "A common mistake is to confuse entities with attributes. For example, 'Color' should be an attribute of an entity like 'Car', not an entity itself. Another mistake is creating overly complex diagrams without a clear understanding of the business requirements."
