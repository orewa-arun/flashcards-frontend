      "question_text": "A regional hospital is implementing a new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. The CIO argues that the EHR is a Management Information System (MIS) because it will provide data for strategic decision-making. The head of the cardiology department argues that it is *not* an MIS, but rather a clinical tool. The system will track patient demographics, medical history, lab results, and billing information. It will also provide alerts for potential drug interactions and generate reports on patient outcomes. The hospital's strategic goals include reducing readmission rates and improving patient satisfaction. Which statement *best* explains why the EHR *can* be considered an MIS, despite the cardiology head's concerns?",

      "explanation": "The question tests understanding of MIS as *more* than just IT, but as a tool aligned with strategic goals. The trick is to recognize that the EHR's clinical function is *secondary* to its ability to provide data for strategic decision-making. Option B correctly identifies this. Option A is incorrect because while automation is a benefit, it's not the *primary* reason it's an MIS. Option C overstates the role of algorithms, and Option D focuses on integration without linking it to strategic goals.",

The question focuses on the 'For You' page, which is powered by a recommendation algorithm.

Their goal is to improve patient access to care and reduce healthcare costs. They analyze the competitor's platform and discover that it uses a combination of video conferencing, remote monitoring devices, and AI-powered diagnostic tools. However, the competitor's platform is fully integrated with their Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, allowing seamless data exchange and clinical decision support.
