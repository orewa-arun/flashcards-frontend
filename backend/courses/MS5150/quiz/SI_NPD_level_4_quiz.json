This venture requires establishing new R&D facilities, retraining a significant portion of its workforce, and forging partnerships with technology firms outside its traditional ecosystem. The board is concerned about the immense investment and potential disruption to its existing profitable internal combustion engine (ICE) business. Considering the comprehensive nature of New Product Development (NPD) and its strategic implications, which of the following statements *accurately* reflect the challenges and strategic considerations for the automotive company in this radical EV project?

The prompt highlights that competitors are introducing 'more novel and diverse products'. Relying solely on internal R&D limits the diversity and quantity of ideas (SI_NPD_5), leading to an 'echo chamber' effect. The most significant *second-order consequence* is that this narrow scope makes the company less likely to generate truly disruptive innovations and more susceptible to market changes, as it lacks external perspectives and fresh ideas. Option A is a potential concern but not the *most significant* consequence directly tied to the *lack of idea diversity* from internal-only sourcing. Option B might occur but is a first-order effect on employees, not the broader strategic consequence. Option D is incorrect; internal R&D might have high costs, but the core issue is limited idea *diversity* and *novelty*, not just cost-sharing.",

Option A is correct; robust concept testing is paramount to validate the fundamental demand for eVTOLs and SkyGlide's specific offering before asking for significant public commitment. Option B is correct; regulatory uncertainty is a critical blocker for any aviation venture, and demonstrating a credible path to approval de-risks the investment for pre-order customers.

Option A is correct; the core of luxury often involves immediate access and exclusivity, which a pre-order model (implying a wait and potentially broader access) can undermine. Option B is correct; to justify the wait, luxury brands need to enhance the 'experience' of the pre-order, perhaps through unique insights into craftsmanship or personalization, reinforcing the luxury value proposition. Option C is correct; loyal customers accustomed to a certain brand experience might feel devalued or frustrated by a shift to pre-orders. Option E is correct; managing expectations around delivery is crucial for any pre-order model, but especially for luxury where customer service is part of the premium.
