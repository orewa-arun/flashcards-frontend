        "C"

      "explanation": "C is correct because effective pricing requires a holistic approach, balancing various internal and external factors to arrive at an optimal strategy. Option A is incorrect as considering multiple factors often complicates, but improves, the pricing process. Focusing on a single factor (like costs or lowest price) is a common mistake that can lead to suboptimal outcomes.",
