      "question_text": "A data science team at a marketing firm is building a model to predict customer spending based on their age. They create a scatter plot of spending vs. age and notice a slight curve, but initially proceed without any data transformation. The resulting model has a low R-squared value and the residual plot shows a clear pattern: the residuals are mostly positive for young and old customers, and mostly negative for middle-aged customers. To improve the model, the team considers several approaches. Synthesizing the concepts of point prediction (Lec 1) and data transformation (Lec 1), which of the following actions is most likely to improve the *accuracy* and *reliability* of their spending predictions, and why?",

Option C only transforms the spending data, which may not fully address the issue of non-linearity between age and spending. Option D is overly complex and potentially unnecessary; also, spending data might contain zero values, making the inverse transformation problematic.

Option A ignores the crucial issue of side effects and the regulatory constraints. Option C is an oversimplification that could miss the true relationship between dosage and blood pressure reduction. Option D is ethically irresponsible. The correct answer acknowledges the model's prediction but also recognizes the need to balance effectiveness with safety. It suggests a comprehensive approach that involves both statistical modeling and risk assessment, incorporating the regulatory constraints. The trade-off is between maximizing drug effectiveness and minimizing side effects, and the correct answer provides a framework for making that trade-off in a responsible manner. The ethical dimension adds complexity to the statistical analysis.",

They start by visualizing the data and notice a non-linear relationship between temperature and sales: sales increase with temperature up to a certain point, then decline during extreme heat. They decide to incorporate a quadratic term for temperature ($X_3^2$) in their multiple regression model. After fitting the model, they notice that while the model fits the training data well, its performance on a holdout set is significantly worse. Considering the need for transformation and understanding the overall regression process (Lecture 1.6), what is the most likely cause of this discrepancy and what action should be taken?",

      "explanation": "This question synthesizes understanding of the regression process, particularly model fitting and prediction (Lecture 1.6), with the potential for overfitting when using polynomial transformations (Lecture 1.5). Option A, while multicollinearity *can* be a problem, doesn't address the core issue of overfitting. Removing the linear term and only using the quadratic would likely worsen the model's ability to predict the *increasing* portion of the curve. Option C (collecting more data) *could* help, but it doesn't address the immediate problem of overfitting with the *current* data. Option D (coding error) is a general troubleshooting step but isn't the *most likely* explanation given the scenario. The correct answer directly addresses the issue of overfitting by suggesting regularization or simplification. Regularization adds a penalty for model complexity, while removing the quadratic term directly reduces complexity. The trade-off is between model fit and model generalizability, and the correct answer prioritizes generalizability to unseen data.",

They consider including a quadratic term for location score ($X_3^2$). After fitting the initial multiple regression model (without the quadratic term), they find that the residuals show a pattern – they are smaller for houses with average location scores and larger for houses in the best and worst locations.

Option D ignores the model diagnostics, which is a critical mistake. The correct answer recognizes that the residual pattern indicates heteroscedasticity, which needs to be addressed *before* focusing solely on the non-linearity.
