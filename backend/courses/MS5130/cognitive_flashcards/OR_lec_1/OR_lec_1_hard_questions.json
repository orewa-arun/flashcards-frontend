      "scenario": "A logistics company wants to optimize its delivery routes to minimize fuel consumption and delivery time. They have considered using Operations Research techniques to model this complex problem. The company's manager is debating which OR technique would be most suitable for this specific problem.",
      "question": "Which of the following Operations Research techniques would be MOST appropriate for the logistics company's route optimization problem?",
      "options": [
        "A. Markov Decision Processes, as it can handle the probabilistic nature of traffic conditions and route changes.",
        "B. Queuing Theory, as it focuses on managing the flow of deliveries and minimizing waiting times at delivery locations.",
        "C. Mathematical Optimization, as it allows for the modeling of multiple constraints (fuel, time, distance) and finding the optimal route.",
        "D. Data Analysis, as it can reveal patterns in past delivery data to predict future delivery times and route efficiencies."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C. Mathematical Optimization, as it allows for the modeling of multiple constraints (fuel, time, distance) and finding the optimal route.",
      "explanation": "Mathematical optimization is best suited for route optimization as it can handle multiple constraints such as fuel consumption, time, and distance to find the most efficient routes. Markov Decision Processes would be useful if the delivery environment was very uncertain, which isn't the primary goal here. Queuing theory is more applicable when dealing with waiting lines. Data analysis can inform the optimization, but it's not a technique in itself."

        "C. Integer Linear Programming, as it extends Linear Programming to handle integer variables, which are essential for representing crew assignments.",

      "correct_answer": "C. Integer Linear Programming, as it extends Linear Programming to handle integer variables, which are essential for representing crew assignments.",
      "explanation": "Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is the most appropriate technique because crew assignments must be whole numbers (you can't assign half a crew). While Linear Programming can model the relationships, it doesn't guarantee integer solutions. Dynamic Programming could be used, but the problem is best expressed as a set of linear constraints with integer requirements. Queuing Theory is not directly applicable to crew scheduling."

      "type": "mcq",
      "question": "In a Linear Programming model for a manufacturing process, the model assumes that the cost of labor is constant per unit produced. However, due to overtime pay for exceeding a certain production level, the labor cost increases significantly. Which LP property is violated and what is the implication?",
      "options": [
        "A. Divisibility is violated, implying that only integer quantities can be produced.",
        "B. Certainty is violated, implying that the optimal solution is uncertain.",
        "C. Proportionality is violated, implying that the cost per unit is no longer constant.",
        "D. Additivity is violated, implying that the labor costs of different products are interdependent."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C. Proportionality is violated, implying that the cost per unit is no longer constant.",
      "explanation": "The violation of proportionality arises because the labor cost is no longer directly proportional to the number of units produced due to overtime pay. This makes the cost function non-linear, violating a key assumption of LP."

      "scenario": "A manufacturing company has two machines that can produce the same two products, but each machine has different processing times for each product. Product A is faster to produce on Machine 1, and Product B is faster to produce on Machine 2. The company wants to determine the optimal production plan to maximize profit, considering the different processing times and machine capacities.",

      "correct_answer": "D. Linear Programming, with decision variables representing the quantity of each product produced on each machine and constraints for machine capacity and product demand.",
      "explanation": "Linear Programming is the best approach as it allows the company to define decision variables for the production quantity of each product on each machine. The constraints will represent the machine capacities and potentially product demands. This allows the model to optimize the allocation of production to each machine based on their respective efficiencies."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "C. The extended problem allows each product to be produced on either of two machines, while the original assumes a single machine for each product.",
      "explanation": "The key difference is the introduction of routing flexibility in the extended problem, allowing each product to be manufactured on either machine. This adds complexity by requiring the model to determine not only the quantities to produce but also where to produce them. The number of products remains two, and both problems allow for divisible production quantities."
