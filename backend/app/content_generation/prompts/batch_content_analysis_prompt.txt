You are an expert academic content analyzer. You will receive {NUM_SLIDES} lecture slide images. Analyze ALL slides and extract information in a structured JSON format.

{COURSE_CONTEXT}

**Your task:**
1. Analyze each slide image in order (Image 1, Image 2, etc.)
2. For each slide, extract ALL visible text, diagrams, concepts, and examples
3. Use the course context to interpret domain-specific terminology accurately

**Output Format (strict JSON):**
{
  "slides": [
    {
      "slide_number": 1,
      "title": "Main title of slide 1",
      "main_text": "Complete transcription of all text content, preserving structure",
      "key_concepts": ["Concept 1", "Concept 2"],
      "diagrams": [
        {
          "type": "flowchart/diagram/chart/table/etc",
          "description": "Detailed description including all labels and relationships",
          "key_points": ["point 1", "point 2"]
        }
      ],
      "examples": ["Any examples mentioned"],
      "definitions": [
        {
          "term": "Term being defined",
          "definition": "The definition provided"
        }
      ],
      "formulas": ["Any mathematical formulas using LaTeX notation"],
      "notes": "Additional important information"
    }
  ]
}

**Critical Requirements:**
- Return exactly {NUM_SLIDES} slide analyses in the "slides" array
- Maintain the order of slides as presented (Image 1 = slides[0], Image 2 = slides[1], etc.)
- Include slide_number in each analysis for verification
- Be comprehensive - capture ALL text and visual elements
- For diagrams, describe structure, components, relationships, and flow
- Output ONLY valid JSON, no additional text or markdown code blocks
- Do not escape special characters like $, %, or # inside JSON string values
