1. You update the courses.json, You get the structured_analysis from gemini chat, just the json is enough
2. remove the \\ from the json file!
3. Then you apply the flashcard_generation.main script
4. Then you ask claude from cursor to fix the mermaid_diagrams and math_visualizations: using something like this:
Here's the thing, you are not to recreate/tamper any other field except the following in @DAA_lec_4_cognitive_flashcards.json 

mermaid_diagrams, math_visualizations.
Read the  @intelligent_flashcard_prompt.txt , to get an idea of what must go into these objects.
Don't tamper with anything else. Make all the changes in the existing file itself.
Update only the mermaid_diagrams and math_visualizations fields in the existing MIS_lec_4_cognitive_flashcards.json file by reading the content and regenerating just those specific fields
I want you to manually read the json file and regenerate each and every single by creating a better, correct version of it.
IMPORTANT:
I don't want you to create any script, do it manually, whatever it takes.


5. You copy the courses to public/ and backend/

cd /Users/arunkumarmurugesan/Documents/entreprenuer-apps/self-learning-ai && cp courses/MS5031/cognitive_flashcards/DAA_lec_4/DAA_lec_4_cognitive_flashcards.json frontend/public/courses/MS5031/cognitive_flashcards/DAA_lec_4/DAA_lec_4_cognitive_flashcards.json && echo "✓ Copied to frontend/public" && cp courses/MS5031/cognitive_flashcards/DAA_lec_4/DAA_lec_4_cognitive_flashcards.json backend/courses/MS5031/cognitive_flashcards/DAA_lec_4/DAA_lec_4_cognitive_flashcards.json && echo "✓ Copied to backend"
