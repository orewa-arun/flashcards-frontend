      "answers": {
        "concise": "An Entity-Relationship (E-R) Model is a diagramming technique used to visually represent entities, their attributes, and the relationships between those entities in a database system.",
        "analogy": "Think of an E-R model like a blueprint for a building. The entities are the rooms (e.g., bedroom, kitchen), the attributes are the characteristics of each room (e.g., size, color), and the relationships are how the rooms connect to each other (e.g., 'is adjacent to').",
        "eli5": "Imagine you're drawing a map of your toys. The E-R model is like that map. The toys are the 'entities,' their colors and sizes are their 'attributes,' and how they're grouped together is their 'relationship.'",
        "real_world_use_case": "A hospital uses an E-R model to design its patient database. 'Patient' is an entity with attributes like 'Patient ID,' 'Name,' and 'Date of Birth.' 'Doctor' is another entity. The relationship 'Treats' connects patients to doctors, defining who is responsible for which patient.",
        "common_mistakes": "A common mistake is to confuse entities with attributes. For example, 'Color' should be an attribute of an entity like 'Car', not an entity itself. Another mistake is creating overly complex diagrams without a clear understanding of the business requirements."

The 'Course' entity has attributes like 'CourseID', 'CourseName', and 'Credits'. The relationship 'Enrolls in' connects students and courses, indicating which students are taking which courses.

Intersection data could be the 'Quantity' of a specific product purchased by a customer in a particular order, the 'Discount' applied to that product for that customer, or the 'Date' of the purchase.  These details describe the specific transaction between the customer and the product, not just properties of the customer or the product alone.",
        "common_mistakes": "A common mistake is confusing intersection data with attributes of the entities themselves. Intersection data describes the *relationship* between entities, while entity attributes describe the *entities* themselves.

(2) Create separate tables for each entity and place the primary key of one entity as a foreign key in the other entity's table. (3) Create separate tables for each entity and place the primary key of the second entity as a foreign key in the first entity's table.",
        "analogy": "Imagine two people who are married. Option 1 is to list all the information about both people on a single form. Options 2 and 3 are to have two separate forms, but one form has a field that refers back to the other person's form (like a spouse ID).",

Option 1 combines employee and car details into one table if access patterns favor retrieving both together. Options 2 and 3 keep them separate, useful if car details are rarely needed with employee data or vice versa. Option 2 might place CarID as a foreign key in the Employee table; Option 3 places EmployeeID as a foreign key in the Car table.",

Combining the tables (option 1) can lead to redundancy if one entity has many attributes that are rarely used.
