        "concise": "A point prediction in regression analysis is a single, best estimate ($\\hat{Y}$) for the value of the response variable ($Y$) given a specific value ($X^*$) of the explanatory variable ($X$), based on the fitted regression equation.",
        "analogy": "Think of a point prediction like using a recipe to estimate how many cookies you'll get. The recipe (regression equation) uses ingredients (explanatory variables) to predict the number of cookies (response variable). The point prediction is your single best guess of the cookie yield based on the recipe.",
        "eli5": "Imagine you're trying to guess how tall someone will be based on their age. A point prediction is like making one specific guess, like 'they'll be 4 feet tall when they're 8 years old,' based on what you've seen before.",

They use a regression model to predict subscriber growth (Y) based on marketing budget (X). The point prediction is their single best estimate of subscriber numbers for the upcoming quarter, guiding their financial planning.",
        "common_mistakes": "A common mistake is to assume a point prediction is a guaranteed outcome. It's just an estimate based on the model and data. Another mistake is extrapolating far beyond the observed data range, assuming the relationship will hold true, which can lead to wildly inaccurate predictions."

However, if their data only included houses up to 3000 square feet, predicting the price of a 5000 square foot mansion based on this model would be an unreliable extrapolation.",
