The marketing team initially focused solely on highlighting the low subscription fee.

Consumers are sensitive to price changes for such discretionary purchases. Therefore, 'Velvet Cacao' would likely experience highly elastic demand. A suitable initial pricing strategy would be to consider competitive pricing or promotional offers to attract customers, as even a small price reduction could lead to a proportionally larger increase in quantity demanded, which is crucial for market entry. Option A is incorrect; such a product is unlikely to have inelastic demand. Option C is incorrect as unitary elasticity is a very specific condition and not the most probable for a new luxury good. Option D is incorrect as perfectly inelastic demand is rare and typically applies only to absolute necessities with no substitutes.",

With unitary elasticity, total revenue remains constant, which can be seen here: $10 * 1,000,000 = $10,000,000, and $11 * 900,000 = $9,900,000 (slight difference due to rounding in scenario, but the proportionate change is key).
