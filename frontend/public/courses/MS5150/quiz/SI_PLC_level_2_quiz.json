      "explanation": "A product line with low market share in a slow-growing market is classified as a 'Dog'. The most suitable strategy is to divest or liquidate the product line. Option A is unlikely to be successful in a slow-growing market. Option B may not be sustainable. Option D could be considered, but the potential for success is low.",

      "correct_answer": "The company will likely waste resources with little to no return on investment.",
      "explanation": "Over-investing in 'Dogs' is a common mistake. Dogs, by definition, have low market share in slow-growing markets, making it unlikely that investment will result in significant growth. Option A is an unrealistic expectation. Option C and D are unlikely scenarios given the inherent characteristics of a 'Dog'.",
