      "answers": {
        "concise": "The Product Life Cycle (PLC) describes the stages a product goes through from when it is first introduced into the market until it declines and is eventually removed or replaced.",
        "analogy": "Think of the PLC like a human life: a product is 'born' (introduced), 'grows up' (growth stage), becomes 'mature' (maturity stage), and eventually 'declines' and 'passes away' (decline stage).",
        "eli5": "Imagine you plant a seed (the product). It sprouts (introduction), grows big and strong (growth), stays big for a while (maturity), and then gets old and weak (decline). That's the product life cycle!",
        "real_world_use_case": "Apple uses the PLC to manage its iPhone product line. They introduce a new model (introduction), rapidly increase sales (growth), saturate the market (maturity), and eventually discontinue older models as new ones are introduced (decline). Understanding the PLC allows Apple to optimize marketing spend, production, and pricing for each iPhone generation.",
        "common_mistakes": "A common mistake is assuming all products follow the same PLC curve. Some products have very short lifecycles (fads), while others have long maturity stages. Ignoring these variations can lead to incorrect forecasting and poor strategic decisions."

Coca-Cola's ongoing efforts to innovate with new flavors and marketing campaigns are examples of extending the maturity stage.",
