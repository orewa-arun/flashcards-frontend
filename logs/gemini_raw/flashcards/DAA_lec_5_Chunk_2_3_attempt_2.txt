    "answers": {
      "concise": "The key criteria for selecting a regression model include the type of dependent variable, business objective, model interpretability, adherence to model assumptions, and the balance between predictive and explanatory power.",
      "analogy": "Imagine you're picking a tool from a toolbox (regression models) for a specific task (business problem). You wouldn't use a hammer to cut wood. You evaluate based on what you need to build (objective), how precise you need to be (predictive power), how easy it is to explain to others (interpretability), and if the tool fits the materials you have (assumptions).",
      "eli5": "Picking the right math game (regression model) depends on what kind of answer you need. Do you want to guess a number (like how many candies you'll eat)? Or a 'yes' or 'no' answer (like if you'll share your candies)? Also, does the game make sense, and do you have all the right pieces to play it fairly?",
      "real_world_use_case": "A marketing team deciding between models to predict customer response: if they want to predict the *amount* a customer will spend, they'd look for a model for continuous data. If they want to predict *whether* a customer will click an ad (yes/no), they'd need a model for binary outcomes, also considering how easily they can explain the drivers to their campaign managers.",
      "common_mistakes": "A common mistake is selecting a model solely based on its R-squared value without considering the business objective or the type of dependent variable. Forgetting to check if the data meets the model's underlying assumptions can lead to invalid conclusions, regardless of how 'good' the model appears statistically."

For predicting the *amount* a customer will spend on credit cards, they'd choose Multiple Linear Regression because spending is a continuous variable. If they want to predict *whether* a customer will default on a loan, Logistic Regression is appropriate as 'default' is a binary (yes/no) outcome. If they need to compare average balances across different marketing campaigns while controlling for age, ANCOVA would be chosen.

      "concise": "Linear Regression Models (SLR, MLR, ANCOVA) assume linearity between variables, independence and normality of error terms, homoscedasticity (equal variance of errors), and no multicollinearity among independent variables (for MLR, ANCOVA).",

If you don't follow them (e.g., drive off-road, drive with flat tires, or drive a square car), you might still move, but you'll get inaccurate speeds, unreliable directions, and potentially crash (invalid results).",
      "eli5": "Imagine you're building a tower with blocks. The rules are: blocks must be straight on top of each other (linearity), each new block doesn't wiggle because of the last one (independence), they're all the same size (homoscedasticity), and they're not squishy (normality). Also, you can't have two blocks that are almost identical trying to do the same job (no multicollinearity). If you break these rules, your tower might fall over or be crooked.",
      "real_world_use_case": "A financial analyst building a linear regression model to predict stock prices must ensure the assumptions are met. If there's non-linearity, the model will miss the true relationship. If errors are not independent (e.g., from time series data), confidence intervals will be too narrow. Violations can lead to overconfident or incorrect predictions, potentially causing significant financial losses.",
      "common_mistakes": "A common mistake is simply running a regression without checking any assumptions, leading to biased coefficients, incorrect standard errors, and invalid p-values and confidence intervals.
