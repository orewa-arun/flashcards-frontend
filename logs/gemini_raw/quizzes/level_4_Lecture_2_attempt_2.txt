    "question_text": "A marketing analytics team at 'Trendify Apparel' has developed a simple regression model to predict weekly online sales (Y, in thousands of USD) based on weekly advertising spend on social media (X, in thousands of USD). Their observed data for ad spend ranges from $5K to $50K per week. The model output is: Sales = 25 + 1.8 * Ad_Spend. The marketing director is considering a new campaign with a $150K weekly ad spend, projecting sales based on the model. What are the critical concerns and appropriate actions the analytics team should communicate regarding this projection? (Select all that apply)",

      "A": "The projection is an extrapolation beyond the observed data range, making the prediction unreliable and potentially highly inaccurate.",

      "C": "A wider prediction interval would be expected for a $150K ad spend compared to an interpolation, reflecting increased uncertainty.",

    "explanation": "This question synthesizes the Simple Regression Model (FC1) with the concept of Extrapolation (FC2) and the implications for business decision-making. Option A is correct because $150K is significantly outside the observed range of $5K-$50K, making the model's linearity assumption highly questionable for this new X value. Option B correctly identifies the second-order consequence that real-world relationships often become non-linear or plateau beyond a certain point, invalidating the simple linear model. Option E is a pragmatic solution to address the extrapolation risk by gathering new, relevant data. Option C is technically true (extrapolation increases prediction interval width), but the primary concern is the *unreliability* of the prediction itself, making the width almost irrelevant if the center is wrong. Option D is incorrect; R-squared is a measure of fit for the *training data*, not for an extrapolated point.",

There could be confounding variables (e.g., highly motivated employees seek more training and also perform better, or experienced employees need less training but perform better) or even reverse causation (higher performers are selected for more advanced training). The proposed action is a direct second-order consequence of this flawed causal assumption. Option A is a valid concern about model limitations but less fundamental than the causation error. Option C is a general model concern, but even a high R-squared doesn't imply causation.

Option E correctly identifies that if the market index return for the next quarter falls outside the observed historical range (extrapolation), the reliability of *both* intervals will be compromised, and they will become wider.

After collecting data for 60 days, they obtained the model: Sales = 500 + 3.5 * Foot_Traffic.

The scenario explicitly states a 'clear curvilinear pattern' and a 'U-shape' in the residual plot, which are strong indicators of a violation of the linearity assumption. Option A is correct; variable transformation (e.g., polynomial terms, logarithmic transformation) is a common technique to linearize non-linear relationships, allowing a regression model to capture the trend. Option D is also a valid approach. If the relationship changes significantly at different levels of foot traffic, fitting separate linear models for different segments (segmented regression) can be more appropriate than a single global linear model. Option E is also correct; outliers can disproportionately influence the regression line and might create or exaggerate perceived patterns in scatter and residual plots. Option B, while a valid general approach for improving models, doesn't directly address the *non-linearity* problem of the *current* relationship between X and Y; it's about adding *new* variables, not fixing the form of the existing one. Option C is incorrect; a 'U-shape' residual plot is a clear sign of systematic error and non-randomness, not random noise, and an R-squared of 0.60, while moderate, can be significantly improved if the underlying functional form is correctly modeled.",

Option A is the best statement. It correctly interprets the slope coefficient as an 'average increase' and uses 'statistically associated' rather than 'causes,' avoiding the correlation-causation fallacy. It then connects this statistical finding to a practical business implication (streamlining routes for efficiency). Option B is incorrect because a high R-squared and statistical significance do not 'definitively prove' causation; other factors might be at play. Option C incorrectly dismisses the practical impact; 1.2 hours per transfer point can be significant for efficiency, especially across many shipments or if delays accumulate. Option D correctly interprets the intercept but overemphasizes its criticality compared to the statistically significant and actionable relationship found by the slope, especially when the number of transfer points can be strategically managed.",

    "explanation": "This question integrates the concept of Correlation vs. Causation (FC3) with the specific type of reverse causation and its implications for public policy. The most likely dynamic is reverse causation (Option B). Districts with higher crime rates (or perceived higher crime rates) are typically allocated *more* police resources. Therefore, the higher number of police officers is a *response* to the crime, not its *cause*. The mayor's reasoning incorrectly flips the causal arrow, leading to a potentially disastrous policy decision. Option A incorrectly labels 'reported crimes' as a confounding variable in this specific context; it's the dependent variable, and the *existing level* of crime (not just reported) drives police deployment. Option C is highly unlikely given the scenario. Option D is irrelevant; even with a high R-squared, the causal direction remains unproven and misidentified here.",

    "explanation": "This question integrates the Correlation vs. Causation (FC3) pitfall with Simple Regression (FC1), model limitations, and the need for robust experimental design. Option A is correct; a confounding variable, like humidity or the type of material being processed, could be the true driver of both temperature fluctuations and defect rates. Option B is correct; this highlights a second-order consequence. Focusing solely on the correlated variable without understanding causation can lead to new, unforeseen problems or trade-offs. Option C is correct; to establish a causal link, a controlled experiment where temperature is systematically varied while other factors are held constant would be required. Option E is correct; the observed linear correlation might only hold within a certain range. Pushing the temperature to an extreme could lead to non-linear effects, diminishing returns, or new issues. Option D is incorrect; a high R-squared indicates a strong statistical association, but it *never* proves causation in observational studies. Relying on R-squared alone to infer causation is a classic mistake.",

A prediction interval provides a range for a *single, new, individual observation* of the dependent variable. It accounts for both the uncertainty in the estimated regression line and the inherent variability of individual data points around that line. Option A, a Confidence Interval for the Mean, provides a range for the *average* fuel consumption for all 300 km routes, which is suitable for long-term planning, but not for a single specific delivery. Option C is irrelevant for providing a range estimate. Option D is a component used in calculating the intervals but is not an interval itself.",
