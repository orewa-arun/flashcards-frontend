Based solely on this, the team decides to scale up the ad campaign significantly. After a few weeks, the actual conversion rates are much lower than predicted, leading to a substantial budget loss. What critical step did the team most likely overlook that led to this flawed business decision?",

Option B (outliers) might be present but a U-shape specifically points to a systemic non-linear issue, not just isolated points. Option D (normality of residuals) is typically assessed with a Normal Q-Q plot, not a residual vs. fitted plot."

      "interpretation": "A U-shaped residual plot signals that the linear model is too simplistic for the underlying relationship and needs to be adjusted, possibly by adding polynomial terms or using a non-linear model.",

If a model shows non-linearity, it means policies based on a linear assumption might be ineffective or even counterproductive, highlighting the need for a more accurate representation of the environmental processes."

      "text": "A Normal Q-Q plot compares the quantiles of the residuals to the quantiles of a theoretical normal distribution. If the residuals are normally distributed, they should fall approximately along a straight line. Deviations from this line can reveal specific characteristics of non-normality, such as heavy tails or skewness (Option C). The primary purpose is to assess normality (Option A). Heteroscedasticity (Option B) and non-linearity (Option D) are typically assessed using residual plots against fitted values or predictors.",

For example, S-shapes suggest skewness, and points curving away from the line at the ends suggest heavy tails (leptokurtic distribution) or light tails (platykurtic distribution)."
