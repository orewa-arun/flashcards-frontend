      "A": "To analyze non-linear relationships between multiple variables.",

      "D": "To calculate the average value of a single variable."
    },
    "correct_answer": ["B"],
    "explanation": "B is correct because the Simple Regression Model is specifically designed to analyze and quantify the linear relationship between exactly two variables: one dependent (Y) and one independent (X). Option A is incorrect as it describes more complex regression models or non-linear analysis. Options C and D refer to different statistical techniques.",

      "D": "Neither variable is used for prediction."
    },
    "correct_answer": ["B"],
    "explanation": "B is correct. In a Simple Regression Model, the independent variable (X) is used to predict or explain the changes in the dependent variable (Y). Option A is incorrect as it reverses the roles. Options C and D misrepresent the predictive nature of the model.",

The primary danger of extrapolation is that the linear relationship found within the observed data range may not continue to be valid when extended to values far outside that range, leading to unreliable predictions.

The danger of extrapolation lies in the assumption that the linear trend observed within the collected data will indefinitely extend beyond that range, which is often not true.

Option D is incorrect as both are highly relevant.",

    "correct_answer": ["C"],
    "explanation": "C is correct. In this classic example, hot weather is a confounding variable that independently increases both ice cream sales and the number of people swimming (leading to more shark attacks), creating a correlation without direct causation between ice cream and sharks.

Assuming a direct cause-and-effect relationship (B) whenever a strong correlation exists is the core mistake. Option C is incorrect because carefully designed experiments help *establish* causation, preventing this pitfall.
