          "content": "Streamline Social's existing BI Infrastructure (Lecture 6-8) is based on a traditional data warehouse, optimized for structured data. Integrating vast amounts of unstructured (posts, images) and semi-structured (logs) data presents a 'big data' challenge (Lecture 9-11) due to volume, velocity, and variety. Traditional relational data warehouses are ill-suited for this, primarily because they require a predefined schema (Option E), which is impractical and inefficient for highly variable unstructured data. Forcing such data into a rigid schema would lead to 'schema on write' issues, data loss, and poor performance. Option B, replacing the data warehouse entirely, is also problematic; data warehouses are still highly valuable for structured, historical analysis.",

Option A (Data Lake) is correct: A Data Lake is designed to store raw, untransformed data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured) in its native format, enabling 'schema on read' where schema is applied at the time of analysis. This is ideal for exploratory analytics on diverse data. Option C (NoSQL databases) is correct: NoSQL databases are purpose-built for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data with flexible schemas, high scalability, and often better performance for specific big data workloads than relational databases. They can complement a data warehouse by handling the 'variety' aspect of big data. Option D (Big Data processing frameworks) is correct: Frameworks like Apache Spark or Hadoop MapReduce are essential for performing complex, distributed computations and analytics on the massive datasets stored in a Data Lake, enabling insights from the unstructured content.",

This typically means establishing a Data Lake (A) as the landing zone for all raw, diverse data. NoSQL databases (C) can be used for specific types of unstructured/semi-structured data that benefit from their flexible schema and scalability. Then, big data processing frameworks (D) are used to process data within the Data Lake, transform it, and potentially load relevant, aggregated, or summarized data into the existing data warehouse for traditional BI reporting, or directly into analytic platforms. This 'data lakehouse' or hybrid approach allows Streamline Social to leverage the strengths of both traditional data warehousing for structured data and big data technologies for unstructured content, creating a comprehensive and flexible BI ecosystem.",

      "business_context": "For Streamline Social, these architectural adjustments are crucial for unlocking new competitive advantages. By integrating unstructured content, they can identify nuanced trends, measure sentiment, and personalize user experiences at a deeper level than competitors relying solely on structured data, leading to more engaging platforms and targeted advertising opportunities."
