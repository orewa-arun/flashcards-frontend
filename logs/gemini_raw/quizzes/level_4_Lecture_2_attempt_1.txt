After collecting data for 60 days, they run a simple linear regression and find a statistically significant positive relationship with an R-squared of 0.75. The marketing director is excited, proposing to double the number of email blasts to significantly boost website traffic. However, a senior data analyst raises concerns. Synthesizing the concepts of the Simple Regression Model and the distinction between correlation and causation, which of the following considerations are critical for GlobalMart *before* making this strategic decision?

      "A": "The R-squared value, while high, only indicates the proportion of variance in website visitors explained by email blasts, not necessarily a direct causal link.",

Option A correctly identifies that a high R-squared only shows association, not causation. Options B and D are critical aspects of distinguishing correlation from causation, highlighting confounding variables and reverse causation, respectively. Option C brings in the concept of extrapolation, a major pitfall in regression, as significantly increasing email blasts might push X outside the observed data range. Option E is incorrect because the simple regression model *assumes* a linear relationship, not a non-linear one.",

The model yields a strong positive linear relationship with a high R-squared of 0.82 and a statistically significant slope coefficient (p < 0.001). However, upon reviewing the model's residual plot, a colleague observes a distinct 'U-shaped' pattern, where residuals are positive for low and high EPS values, and negative for middle EPS values. Additionally, a Q-Q plot of the residuals deviates significantly from a straight line.

Option B is correct; a high R-squared is not a standalone indicator of model validity if underlying assumptions are violated, as the model's fit might be coincidental or capturing a non-linear trend poorly. Option C is correct as normality of errors is crucial for the validity of confidence and prediction intervals. Option E is correct; while a U-shaped pattern primarily points to non-linearity, it can also be associated with heteroscedasticity, or heteroscedasticity could be present alongside non-linearity, leading to incorrect standard errors. Option D is incorrect; the significance of the slope isn't necessarily invalidated to zero, but rather its *interpretation* under the linear model is flawed; the true relationship might be non-linear, not non-existent.",
