    "question_text": "A tech startup wants to understand the relationship between the number of weekly active users (X) and their subscription revenue (Y). They collect data over several months and observe a generally increasing trend. What is the most appropriate primary objective for applying a Simple Regression Model in this scenario?",

      "A": "To predict next month's subscription revenue based on projected weekly active users.",

      "C": "To determine if user engagement causally leads to higher revenue.",
      "D": "To categorize users into different revenue tiers based on their activity."
    },
    "correct_answer": ["A"],
    "explanation": "The primary objective of a Simple Regression Model is to predict the value of a dependent variable (Y) based on a single independent variable (X), and to understand the nature and strength of their linear association. Option A directly aligns with this objective. Option B is too broad for a simple regression model, which focuses on only two variables. Option C implies causation, which simple regression does not inherently prove without experimental design. Option D describes a classification task, not regression.",

They believe that the total number of packages successfully delivered per day (Y) is influenced by the number of delivery trucks actively operating (X). They gather daily data for a quarter. In the context of building a Simple Regression Model for this relationship, which variable correctly represents the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y)?",

    "explanation": "In a Simple Regression Model, the independent variable (X) is the predictor, and the dependent variable (Y) is the outcome being predicted or explained. Here, the company believes the number of trucks (X) influences packages delivered (Y). Therefore, 'Number of delivery trucks' is the independent variable (X), and 'Total packages delivered' is the dependent variable (Y). Options A, C, and D incorrectly assign the variables or introduce concepts not directly measured as X or Y in a simple regression.",

This aligns perfectly with the retailer's goal of understanding the linear association between advertising spend and sales. Option A describes more advanced models. Option C relates to classification, not regression. Option D is incorrect as simple regression does not automatically control for confounding variables.",

The described relationship—effectiveness increasing, then plateauing, then declining—is distinctly non-linear. Using a linear model here would lead to inaccurate predictions and a misunderstanding of the drug's true behavior. Option A is incorrect as the scenario describes only two primary variables. Option C is incorrect; simple regression *is* for quantitative variables. Option D misrepresents the dual objective of prediction and understanding in regression.",

In this case, predicting for an 8,000 sq ft mansion when the model was built on data from 1,000 to 3,000 sq ft is a clear example of extrapolation.

Factors like diminishing returns or burnout could make the actual relationship non-linear. Option A is a general concern but not specific to extrapolation. Option C is an overgeneralization.

This means the forecast could be highly inaccurate (A), and the linear relationship assumed by the model might break down at such high traffic volumes (B), potentially due to website load issues or oversaturation. Option C is incorrect; R-squared measures model fit on the *training data*, not a single new prediction.

Therefore, collecting new data points that extend the observed range to include P/E ratios around 5 would be the most crucial step. Option A addresses model improvement but not the specific issue of extrapolation. Option C is the common mistake of extrapolation.
