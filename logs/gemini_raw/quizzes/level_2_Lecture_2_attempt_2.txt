    "question_text": "An HR department uses a regression model to predict employee turnover based on years of service. For a new hire, they calculate a 90% prediction interval for their likelihood of turnover. Which of the following statements correctly explains why this prediction interval is typically wider than a 90% confidence interval for the *mean* turnover rate for all employees with similar years of service?",
    "visual_type": "None",
    "visual_code": null,
    "alt_text": null,
    "options": {
      "A": "The prediction interval only accounts for the uncertainty in the regression line's slope, while the confidence interval considers all parameters.",
      "B": "The confidence interval for the mean includes the error associated with individual data points, which the prediction interval does not.",
      "C": "The prediction interval accounts for both the uncertainty in the estimated regression line and the inherent, irreducible variability of individual employee turnover.",
      "D": "The prediction interval uses a larger alpha level (lower confidence) than the confidence interval for the mean."
    },
    "correct_answer": ["C"],
    "explanation": "A key distinction is that a prediction interval (PI) is wider than a confidence interval (CI) for the mean response at the same X value. This is because the PI must account for two sources of uncertainty: the uncertainty in the location of the true regression line *and* the inherent, random variability of individual observations around that line. The CI for the mean only accounts for the uncertainty in the line's position. Option C accurately captures both components of uncertainty for the PI. Options A and B misrepresent the components considered by each interval. Option D is incorrect; the question specifies the same 90% confidence level for both.",

They calculate a 95% prediction interval for the first month's sales. Which of the following are valid interpretations or applications of this prediction interval in a business context?

      "C": "It measures the overall goodness of fit of the regression model, indicating how well the model explains sales variations.",

    "correct_answer": ["A", "B", "D"],
    "explanation": "A prediction interval provides a range for a single, future observation, quantifying the uncertainty around that specific outcome. Option A correctly states it's for the single new product's sales. Option B is a direct business application, using the range to manage expectations. Option D is another practical application, using the range for inventory management. Option C describes the purpose of R-squared, not a prediction interval.",

    },
    "correct_answer": ["A", "B"],
    "explanation": "A prediction interval's width increases as the X value moves further from the mean of the observed X values (Option A), reflecting greater uncertainty at the extremes. It also accounts for both the uncertainty in the regression line and the irreducible error of individual observations (Option B), which is its defining characteristic. Option C is incorrect; a prediction interval is *always wider* than a confidence interval for the mean because it includes the additional variability of a single observation. Option D is incorrect; the sample size (n) is a crucial component in the standard error calculation for the prediction interval.",
