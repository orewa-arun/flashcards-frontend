    "question_text": "A regional sales manager for a beverage company observes a strong positive correlation (r=0.85) between daily outdoor temperature (X) and the sales volume of cold drinks (Y) over the past quarter. Excited by this finding, she develops a simple regression model and uses it to predict sales for an upcoming week when a heatwave is forecast, expecting record-high sales. However, despite the extreme heat, sales only increase marginally. Upon investigation, it's discovered that the local stores ran out of stock due to unexpected demand. What is the *most likely analytical error* in the manager's initial prediction and decision-making process, even with a statistically significant model?",

    "visual_code": null,
    "alt_text": null,
    "options": {
      "A": "The manager failed to consider the non-linear relationship between temperature and sales, as extreme temperatures often lead to a plateau.",
      "B": "The simple regression model incorrectly assumed independence between daily temperatures, leading to biased coefficient estimates.",
      "C": "The model did not account for a critical business constraint (stock availability) which fundamentally altered the observed relationship in a real-world scenario.",
      "D": "The manager should have used a multiple regression model to include other factors like promotional activities and competitor pricing."
    },
    "correct_answer": ["C"],
    "explanation": "The key to this question is the business requirement contradicting the theory. While a simple regression model can quantify a linear relationship, its predictive power in a real-world context is limited if critical external factors or business constraints are ignored. In this scenario, the model accurately captured the historical relationship but failed to predict the future because a new, unmodeled constraint (stockout) interfered. Option C correctly identifies this oversight. Option A might be true for extreme temperatures but the primary issue here is a practical constraint. Option B is a general assumption but not the most direct error in this context. Option D suggests a more complex model, which could be beneficial, but the immediate and most critical error was neglecting the operational constraint.",

Options A, C, and E describe scenarios where a single dependent variable is related to a single independent variable in a potentially linear fashion, making simple regression an appropriate tool to analyze this specific relationship. Option B is incorrect because 'controlling for' other variables implies a need for multiple regression or more complex causal inference techniques, not simple regression.

The model, derived from data ranging from 5 to 10 active lines, shows that each additional active line increases output by 150 units/day (p < 0.01).

The CEO's proposal to increase to 25 or 30 active lines (10 + 20) is far outside this observed range. The trick is that while the model is statistically significant (p < 0.01) within its trained range, there's no guarantee the linear relationship will hold when extrapolating so far. Factors like diminishing returns, logistical bottlenecks, or resource limitations could make the relationship non-linear at higher scales. Option B correctly identifies this risk. Option A discusses multicollinearity, which is relevant for multiple regression, not simple regression. Option C suggests a different model type but misses the immediate issue of applying the *current* model. Option D is a common expert misconception; statistical significance within the observed range does not validate extrapolation.",

Violations of these assumptions can lead to unreliable intervals. Options A, B, C, and D are all critical assumptions for the validity of prediction intervals. If the relationship is not linear (A), the model is fundamentally misspecified. If errors are not independent (B), standard errors are biased. If errors are not normal (C), the confidence level of the interval is inaccurate. If there is heteroscedasticity (D), the interval width will be inconsistent and unreliable (too wide in some areas, too narrow in others). Option E, 'Lack of Multicollinearity,' is primarily a concern for multiple regression models when interpreting individual coefficient effects, not a direct assumption for simple regression's prediction interval reliability.",

After collecting data for six months, the model yields `Revenue = 5000 + 10 * AdSpend` with an R-squared of 0.25 and a p-value for AdSpend < 0.05. The owner plans to increase AdSpend from $1000 to $5000 next month, confidently expecting a $45,000 revenue increase.

      "C": "The model implicitly assumes that the additional $4000 in ad spend will have a consistent linear return, which might not hold true for higher spending.",
      "D": "The owner should consider a time-series model rather than a simple regression for monthly predictions."
    },
    "correct_answer": ["A"],
    "explanation": "This question tests the understanding of R-squared in practical decision-making, despite statistical significance. While the p-value indicates that AdSpend is a statistically significant predictor (Option B is a common misconception, p-value doesn't imply causation or realism), an R-squared of 0.25 means that only 25% of the variation in revenue is explained by ad spend. This leaves 75% unexplained by the model, suggesting other major factors influence revenue. Therefore, expecting a large, predictable increase based solely on this model for a significant jump in ad spend is overly optimistic and risky because the model has limited explanatory power. Option A correctly identifies this as the most significant limitation. Option C is a concern (extrapolation), but the low R-squared highlights the model's general inadequacy, even within range. Option D is not the *most significant* limitation for *this specific expectation*.",

A new medical researcher, facing a rare, aggressive form of the disease, proposes using the model to predict efficacy for a 500mg dosage to achieve a higher therapeutic effect.

    },
    "correct_answer": ["A"],
    "explanation": "The core of this question lies in the danger of extrapolation, especially in a critical field like pharmaceuticals. The model was trained on dosages between 10mg and 100mg. Attempting to predict efficacy at 500mg is a substantial extrapolation. The most critical risk (Option A) is that the linear relationship observed within the tested range might not hold at much higher dosages. Drug effects often plateau, or even become harmful/toxic, beyond a certain threshold. This directly invalidates the linear assumption of the model in the extrapolated region. Option B is a general regression issue but not the *most critical* for this specific scenario of extreme extrapolation. Option C is unlikely in this context. Option D is incorrect; extrapolation typically leads to *wider*, less reliable prediction intervals, not narrower ones, precisely because of increased uncertainty.",

    "explanation": "This question tests the understanding of 'extrapolation' not just as 'outside the range' but also its degree. Extrapolation occurs when predicting for X values outside the observed range of [100, 1000] hours. Options A and D are within the observed range, so predictions for them are considered reliable in terms of extrapolation. Option B (1200 hours) is outside the upper range, representing extrapolation. Option C (50 hours) is outside the lower range, also extrapolation. Option E (2500 hours) is significantly outside the upper range, making it a high-risk extrapolation.

While refusing to provide a forecast (Option B) might seem statistically pure, in a business context, it's often not feasible when a CEO demands information. Simply providing the forecast without caveats (Option C) is irresponsible. Performing an experiment (Option D) is ideal for future modeling but impractical for an *immediate* forecast demand. The most responsible action (Option A) is to provide the forecast using the available (though flawed for this purpose) model, but crucially, to clearly communicate the significant risks and limitations due to extrapolation.
