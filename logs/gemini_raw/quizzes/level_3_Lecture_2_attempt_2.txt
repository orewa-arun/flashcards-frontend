    "question_text": "A leading e-commerce company, 'GlobalMart,' wants to understand the relationship between their daily website traffic (X, in thousands of unique visitors) and their daily sales revenue (Y, in thousands of USD). They have collected data for the past six months and developed a Simple Regression Model, which shows a strong positive linear relationship with a high R-squared value. The marketing department wants to use this model to predict sales, but the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) insists that the model must also account for the impact of fluctuating exchange rates, which significantly affect product pricing and, consequently, sales. What is the most critical limitation of the *Simple Regression Model* that prevents it from directly addressing the CFO's concern?",

      "A": "Simple Regression assumes that the relationship between variables is non-linear, which might not hold for sales and exchange rates.",

    },
    "correct_answer": ["C"],
    "explanation": "The key to this question is understanding the fundamental definition of a Simple Regression Model. The trick lies in the business requirement (CFO's concern) conflicting with the model's core assumption. Option C correctly identifies that Simple Regression is explicitly limited to one dependent and one independent variable. Therefore, it cannot directly incorporate additional factors like exchange rates. Option A is incorrect because Simple Regression *assumes* a linear relationship. Option B is incorrect as prediction is a primary objective of regression. Option D is incorrect; a high R-squared does not preclude the influence of other variables or make further analysis redundant, especially if those variables are important drivers not captured.",

Option B requires a *non-linear regression model* or transformations within a multiple regression framework, as Simple Regression assumes a strictly linear relationship. Option C is a direct application of Simple Regression for prediction or estimation within the model's assumptions, thus it does not require moving beyond it.

    "question_text": "A leading SaaS company, 'CloudSolutions,' developed a simple regression model to predict customer support ticket resolution time (Y, in minutes) based on the customer's subscription tier (X, coded as 1 for Basic, 2 for Premium, 3 for Enterprise). The model was built using data from their first 5,000 customers. The data showed that subscription tiers 1, 2, and 3 typically involve between 10 to 50 support interactions per month. Due to rapid growth, CloudSolutions is introducing a new 'Elite' tier (coded as 4) for their largest clients, expecting them to generate over 100 interactions per month, and the CEO wants to use the existing model to predict their resolution times.

    "correct_answer": ["C"],
    "explanation": "The core issue here is extrapolation. The trick is that 'Elite' tier represents not just a new category but also a significantly different usage pattern (100+ interactions) that falls outside the observed data range (10-50 interactions) used to train the model. Option C correctly identifies this as extrapolation, which leads to unreliable predictions because the linear relationship might not hold true beyond the original data's scope. Option A is a possible outcome but not the *most significant risk* of applying the model in this way. Option B is incorrect; while subscription tier is ordinal, it can be handled in regression (e.g., as dummy variables, or numerically if the spacing is assumed linear, which is often done in simple models, but the *range* is the issue here). Option D is incorrect; while regression provides an average, the primary risk isn't the average itself but the *accuracy* of that average when extrapolating.",

    "correct_answer": ["A", "B"],
    "explanation": "This question focuses on the risks associated with extrapolation in a practical business scenario. The trick is to identify the direct consequences of predicting beyond the observed data range. Option A is correct because the underlying relationship between temperature and electricity consumption often changes at extreme values (e.g., at very high temperatures, AC usage might hit a saturation point or be constrained by grid capacity, altering the linearity). Option B is also correct as it directly defines the nature and risk of extrapolation. Option C is incorrect; simple regression can be used for various forecasts, not just seasonal trends, provided its assumptions hold. Option D, while a point estimate alone might be less useful than an interval, it's not a direct *concern regarding extrapolation itself* but rather a general limitation of point estimates. The primary risks of extrapolation are the potential for the model's assumptions (like linearity) to fail.",

They found a strong positive correlation, with a regression model indicating that for every 1% increase in GDP growth, the stock market index rises by 50 points.

    "correct_answer": ["B"],
    "explanation": "This question directly addresses the core pitfall of confusing correlation with causation. The trick lies in the strategist's strong causal assertion based solely on a correlation. Option B correctly identifies this fundamental error: a strong correlation does not automatically imply causation. There could be confounding variables (e.g., global economic sentiment, technological innovation driving both), or even reverse causation (a booming stock market might signal investor confidence that fuels economic activity and future GDP growth). Option A is incorrect because the dependent/independent variable assignment in regression does not prevent one from influencing the other; it's about the direction of the statistical model. Option C is a general statement about model complexity but not the *most significant oversight* if the fundamental causal inference is wrong. Option D is incorrect; a 50-point rise for 1% GDP growth can be highly significant in financial markets.",

Option D is particularly relevant in health studies, where the placebo effect can create a perceived causal link that isn't physiological.

The trick is the manager's expectation of a narrow interval for a single, future event. Option B correctly explains that a Prediction Interval, which is what the manager needs for *tomorrow's specific transaction volume*, accounts for both the uncertainty in the estimated regression line *and* the natural, irreducible variability of individual observations around that line. This makes PIs inherently wider than CIs for the mean. Option A is incorrect because a CI for the mean is *narrower* than a PI. Option C is incorrect; while a violation of linearity would affect reliability, a wide PI is a normal characteristic, not direct proof of such a violation, especially for a single observation. Option D is incorrect; the number of active accounts is a quantitative variable, and even if it were categorical, that's not the primary reason for a wide PI for a *single* observation versus a mean.",

The linear relationship observed within $1,000-$5,000 might not hold at much higher spending levels; for example, diminishing returns could set in.

The trick is the CEO's valid concern about unmodeled factors, which directly points to the limitations of 'simple' regression. Option B correctly states that Simple Regression is limited to two variables and that a multiple regression model is needed to incorporate additional quantitative or qualitative (via dummy variables) predictors like seasonality and competitor promotions. Option A is incorrect; a high R-squared only indicates the model's fit to the *included* variables, not that unincluded variables are irrelevant. Option C is incorrect; statistical significance indicates a relationship is unlikely by chance, but does not prove causation, and certainly doesn't make other factors irrelevant in explaining the full picture. Option D is incorrect; qualitative variables can indeed be included in regression analysis through appropriate coding (e.g., dummy variables).",

Option B is also correct; the underlying relationship might change for newer technology or at extended ages, invalidating the original model's assumptions. Option D is correct; uncertainty in regression predictions (whether PI or CI for the mean) increases as you move further from the mean of the independent variable, which is a consequence of extrapolation.

The trick is the manager's expectation of a narrow interval for a single, future event. Option B correctly explains that a Prediction Interval, which is what's needed for *this specific new shipment*, accounts for both the uncertainty in the estimated regression line *and* the natural variability of individual outcomes (like varied traffic, weather, or driver habits for each delivery). This inherent variability makes PIs wider than CIs for the mean. Option A is incorrect; a CI for the mean is *narrower* than a PI. Option C is incorrect; a wide PI doesn't automatically imply non-linearity, especially if the model showed a good fit (high R-squared) within its valid range. Option D is a valid concern for wide intervals, but the question implies 'good fit' and doesn't explicitly state 1,500 lbs is an extrapolation, so the most *likely* reason for a wide PI is the inherent individual variability.",
