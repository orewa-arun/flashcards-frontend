After a lull, auto companies gear up for the storm
in festive season
DOMS
By Shally Mohile, ET Bureau Last Updated Sep 22, 2005, 12:07:00 AM IST
Synopsis
Auto retallers in Mumbal anticipate increased sales during the upcoming festive season, starting with Navratri. Recent GST 20 tax cuts
caused a sales slowdown. Dealers faced losses due to buyers delaying purchases. They are clearing old stock before the new OST rates take
effect. Retallers are concerned about unused compensation coss credits and are urging the government for relief
After the lull of Shraadh-typically marked by muted footfalls and weak sales-auto
retailers are pinning hopes on the festive season that begins Monday with
Navratri. While such seasonal swings are familiar, this year is unusual The
government's sweeping tax cuts under GST 2.0, announced more than two weeks
before its implementation on Monday, coincided with the Shraadh fortnight,
bringing sales to a near standstill as potential buyers waited for the new tax rates
to take effect and the inauspicious period to end.
MSME in Tomanow's
About 15% of annual auto industry sales are generated during the 42-day festive
AWARDS 25 Builders
period, spanning Navratri to 15 days past Dhanteras (which includes Bhai Dooj).
This makes the current weeks critical for dealers looking to recover lost
momentum. Dealership checks in Mumbai's central-eastern suburbs just two days before GST 2.0 took effect,
underscored the slowdown. At a Tata Motors showroom, three of five customer-engagement tables were occupied, and
families walked in steadily, but few were ready to close deals.
"Enquiries are up 10-12% year-on-year as well as month-on-month, but no one is buying," said the general manager, who
pegged losses on models such as the Safari and Harrier at 240-445 lakh in the past three weeks. He expects to recover the
shortfall during the festive rush.
