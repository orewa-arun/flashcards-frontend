It's not just about tracking stock levels; it's a sophisticated MIS that uses real-time sales data to predict demand, optimize supply chains, and ensure shelves are stocked with the right products at the right time. This system directly impacts Walmart's ability to maintain low prices and meet customer needs, driving its overall business strategy. Without this MIS, Walmart would struggle to compete effectively in the retail landscape. This demonstrates how technology enables business strategy and operations.",
